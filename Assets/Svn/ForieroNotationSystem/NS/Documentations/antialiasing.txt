Notion : We will need to talk to some expert from Unity to solve the antialiasing issues. We need their advice what would be the best approach to our NS.


DESKTOP
-------
Generally you have two options for antialising for Desktops. First is build it anitaliasing in quality settings. Second is free to download Post Processing Stack from GitHub. 


MOBILE
------

For performance reasons please use Post Processing Stack - Antialiasing only.
