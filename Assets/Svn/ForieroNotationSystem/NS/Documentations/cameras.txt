CAMERAS SETUP
-------------

We need to use two cameras and two canvases. One camera for fixed canvas. Second movable camera for movable stave objects. 
We move with movable camera NOT WITH movable objects. Seems like there is unlimited number of objects allowed if moving camera. No perfomance costs or just very little.
